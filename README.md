Mono.TextTemplating is an open-source implementation of the T4 text templating engine, an easy, general purpose way to use C# to generate any kind of text files.

T4 templates can be executed directly via the `TextTransform.exe` tool, or compiled into C# classes that can be embedded in your app and executed at runtime.
